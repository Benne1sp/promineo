              <p class="card-text">In World of Warcraft, a tank is a character role responsible for absorbing damage and 
                protecting other members of a group or raid. Tanks draw the attention of enemies using abilities that 
                generate threat. Tanks have high health pools, strong defenses, and abilities to control enemy movement 
                or reduce the damage taken, allowing the rest of the team to focus on dealing damage. Their primary job 
                is to survive while managing threat and positioning enemies for optimal attacks from the team.</p>

              <p class="card-text">In World of Warcraft, a healer is a character role focused on restoring health to 
                allies during combat. Healers use spells and abilities to heal damage taken by group members, ensuring 
                they stay alive throughout encounters. Healers need to manage their resources, prioritize targets, and 
                react quickly to shifting situations, balancing healing output with positioning to avoid taking damage 
                themselves. Their primary goal is to keep the team alive and ensure they can continue to fight.</p>

              <p class="card-text">In World of Warcraft, a DPS, broken into melee and ranged, is a character role focused on dealing damage to enemies. 
                DPS characters aim to output as much damage as possible to defeat enemies quickly. They have abilities 
                designed to maximize their damage, while also managing resources. DPS players typically focus on avoiding 
                damage and positioning themselves optimally to contribute to the success of the group or raid. Their primary 
                role is to eliminate threats as efficiently as possible.</p>
